# Softadastra Community Events

This document defines how community events related to Softadastra are organized and conducted.

Events are considered an extension of the foundation’s communication and governance. Their purpose is to deepen understanding, not to generate hype.

## Purpose of events

Softadastra events exist to:

- explain architectural decisions
- share implementation experience
- discuss constraints and trade-offs
- gather informed technical feedback

Events are not marketing campaigns or product launches.

## Types of events

### 1. Technical talks

Focused presentations on:

- architecture and design choices
- sync, networking, and resilience topics
- lessons learned from reference implementations

Talks prioritize depth and correctness over accessibility.

### 2. Design discussions

Small-group discussions intended to:

- review architectural proposals
- challenge assumptions
- surface edge cases

Design discussions are moderated and goal-oriented.

### 3. Workshops and hack sessions

Hands-on sessions focused on:

- building reference components
- experimenting with sync and networking primitives
- testing failure scenarios

Workshops are exploratory, not feature-driven.

## Event principles

All Softadastra events must follow these principles:

- **Technical depth first** : no superficial content
- **Honesty about limitations** : no overpromising
- **Respect for long-term vision** : no pressure to pivot
- **Small and focused** : scale is not the goal

## Audience

Events are primarily intended for:

- systems engineers
- backend and distributed-systems developers
- architects and researchers

They are not optimized for general audiences or non-technical stakeholders.

## Frequency and scale

Softadastra favors:

- infrequent but meaningful events
- small groups with high signal
- long-form discussions

Large conferences or mass events are not a priority.

## Transparency and recordings

When appropriate:

- talks may be recorded
- materials may be published publicly

However, some design discussions may remain private to preserve focus and depth.

## Relationship to the roadmap

Events do not drive the roadmap.

They inform understanding, surface issues, and refine implementation details, but do not override architectural direction.

## Summary

Softadastra community events exist to cultivate a thoughtful, technically rigorous ecosystem.

By keeping events focused, honest, and architecture-driven, Softadastra ensures that community engagement strengthens the foundation rather than diluting it.
