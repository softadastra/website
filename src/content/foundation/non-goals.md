# Softadastra Non-Goals

This document defines what Softadastra explicitly does **not** aim to be or solve.

Non-goals are as important as goals. They protect the foundation from dilution, misinterpretation, and short-term pressure.

Any initiative that contradicts these non-goals must be rejected.

---

## 1. Not a frontend framework

Softadastra is **not**:

- a replacement for React, Vue, or similar UI frameworks
- a UI toolkit or component library
- a design system

UI technologies may be used on top of Softadastra, but they are not part of the foundation.

---

## 2. Not a cloud-first platform

Softadastra does **not** assume:

- permanent connectivity
- centralized infrastructure
- mandatory cloud services

Cloud-based deployments are optional optimizations, never dependencies.

---

## 3. Not a SaaS product

Softadastra is **not**:

- a hosted service
- a subscription-based application
- a closed platform

Products may be built on Softadastra, but the foundation itself is not a SaaS.

---

## 4. Not a short-term startup experiment

Softadastra is not optimized for:

- rapid pivots
- trend-driven development
- short-term valuation

It is a long-term infrastructure effort with a multi-year horizon.

---

## 5. Not "web for bad networks"

Softadastra is **not** a degraded version of the web.

It is:

- a more resilient architecture
- applicable to all environments
- beneficial even under ideal conditions

Resilience is a universal requirement, not a niche feature.

---

## 6. Not a monolithic system

Softadastra does **not** aim to be:

- a single massive codebase
- an all-in-one platform
- a tightly coupled system

Modularity and replaceability are core requirements.

---

## 7. Not an abstraction-heavy framework

Softadastra avoids:

- excessive layers of indirection
- opaque abstractions
- hidden magic

Explicit behavior and predictability are preferred over convenience.

---

## 8. Not backward-compatible at all costs

Softadastra does not guarantee compatibility with:

- legacy web assumptions
- cloud-only architectures
- stateless-only models

Breaking with outdated assumptions is sometimes necessary.

---

## 9. Not driven by market trends

Softadastra does not chase:

- hype cycles
- short-lived technologies
- popularity metrics

Adoption is a consequence of correctness, not a primary goal.

---

## Summary

These non-goals define the boundaries of Softadastra.

They exist to ensure that the foundation remains focused, coherent, and resistant to erosion over time.

If something feels appealing but violates a non-goal, it must be rejected.
